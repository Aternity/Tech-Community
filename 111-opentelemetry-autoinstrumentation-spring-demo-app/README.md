# 111-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-spring-demo-app

This cookbook demonstrates how [Alluvio Aternity DEM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/digital-experience-management) collects [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces from a Java app using auto-instrumentation.

To instrument the Java Spring Boot demo app ([Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)), the OpenTelemetry Java agent is simply containerized with the app (the .jar file is copied into the image), injected when the app start and configured to export tracing to [Alluvio Aternity APM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/application-performance-monitoring) via the [Alluvio Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) that is running in an another container.

## Prerequisites

1. an account is Alluvio Aternity APM (SaaS)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Connect to Aternity APM webconsole

Navigate to Aternity APM (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com)) > Agents > Install Agents:

1. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Grab the **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*

### Step 2 - Get the files to run the Cookbook

Download the cookbook, for example [right-click here](https://github.com/Aternity/Tech-Community/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the zip archive, and expand it locally.

### Step 3 - Start the containers

Open a shell and go to the Cookbook folder. Configure the Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector using the environment variables, ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST and ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID, and start all the containers with docker-compose.

For example using Bash:

```bash
# Go to the directory that contains the cookbook
cd Tech-Community-main\111-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-spring-demo-app

# Configure the environment variables for the Aternity OpenTelemetry Collector
export ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```
or else using PowerShell:

```PowerShell
# Go to the directory that contains the cookbook
cd Tech-Community\Tech-Community-main\111-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-spring-demo-app

# Configure the environement variable for the Aternity OpenTelemetry Collector
$env:ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

### Step 4 - Navigate through the app and monitor

Open the url http://localhost:8080 in the web browser and navigate through the app.

Alluvio Aternity APM collects the telemetry the java agent is sending. Every transaction and every OpenTelemetry span can be found in the Search tab.

## Notes 

### Stop the app and all the containers

Press CTRL + C in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```
