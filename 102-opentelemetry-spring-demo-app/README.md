# 102-opentelemetry-spring-demo-app

This cookbook helps to setup Java microservices application with the [Aternity APM OpenTelemetry collector container](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) on a Docker host, to start practicing Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) with [Aternity APM](https://www.aternity.com/application-performance-monitoring/) and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

The sample app is the famous Java Community application called [Spring PetClinic Microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices). Composed of multiple services that run in containers, like Config, Discovery Server, Customers, Vets, Visits and API, it uses [ZipKin](https://zipkin.io/) instrumentation to export some application telemetry (traces for the service calls). The [Aternity APM OpenTelemetry collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) is integrated in the architecture, it also runs in a container, taking the role of the Tracing Server to collect and store the telemetry in the Aternity APM backend (SaaS). 

The [Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) keeps 100% of the traces to provide full fidelity for application performance and behavior analysis. There is no data sampling.

## Prerequisites

1. an Aternity APM account (SaaS)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by Step

### Connect to Aternity APM webconsole

Navigate to Aternity APM (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com)) > Agents > Install Agents:

1. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Grab **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*

### Get the the docker compose

Download a local copy of the file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), for example  [right-click here to download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aternity/Tech-Community/main/102-opentelemetry-spring-demo-app/docker-compose.yml) and save it in the directory `Tech-Community/102-opentelemetry-spring-demo-app`

In this YAML file docker-compose.yml, the *tracing-server* section define the Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector with variables for the CustomerID and the SaaS Analysis Server Host.

```yaml
  tracing-server:
    image: aternity/apm-collector
    container_name: tracing-server
    mem_limit: 128M
    environment:
      - SERVER_URL=wss://${ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST}/?RPM_AGENT_CUSTOMER_ID=${ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID}
    ports:
     - 9411:9411
```

### Start the `spring-petclinit-microservices` app

In a shell, just go in the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). Configure the Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector using environment variable and starts all the containers with docker-compose.

For example, using Bash:

```bash
# Go to the directory that contains docker-compose.yaml
cd Tech-Community/102-opentelemetry-spring-demo-app

# Configure the environment variables for the Aternity OpenTelemetry Collector
export ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

or else using PowerShell:

```PowerShell
# Go to the directory that contains docker-compose.yaml
cd Tech-Community/102-opentelemetry-spring-demo-app

# Configure the environement variable for the Aternity OpenTelemetry Collector
$env:ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

### Exercise the application

Browse http://localhost:8080 and click around to generate some telemetry that will be collected by the Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector

### Open the Aternity APM webconsole to visualize and analyze the traces collected for every transaction

Search transactions:

![Aternity APM OpenTelemetry every transaction](images/aternity-apm-webconsoles-every-transactions.png)

Browse the spans for the selected transaction:

## Notes 

### Support

Please visit [Aternity website](https://www.aternity.com/) if you need support and learn more about [OpenTelemetry with Aternity APM](https://help.aternity.com/bundle/console_install_ost_guide_2022y_console_saas/page/console/topics/apm_ost_ig_intro.html)

### Stop the app and all the containers

Press CTRL + C in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

### Configuring Aternity APM OpenTelemetry Collector

The CustomerID and the SaaS Analysis Server Host configuration of the Aternity APM OpenTelemetry container can be defined directly in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), for example:

```yaml
  tracing-server:
    image: aternity/apm-collector
    container_name: tracing-server
    mem_limit: 128M
    environment:
      - SERVER_URL=wss://agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com/?RPM_AGENT_CUSTOMER_ID=12341234-12341234-13241234
    ports:
     - 9411:9411
```
