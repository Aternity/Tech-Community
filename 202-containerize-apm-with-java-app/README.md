# 202-containerize-apm-with-java-app

This cookbook starts with a Java demo application that runs in a Linux container. For observability, the Aternity APM Java agent for Linux library will be containerized with the app.

The Java application is the [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git) web app, framework version.

## Prerequisites

1. a SaaS account for [Aternity APM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/application-performance-monitoring)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by Step

### Step 1. Get Aternity APM installation details

In the Aternity APM webconsole, navigate to CONFIGURE > AGENTS > Install Agents and in the Agent Installation Steps section,

1. Find your **Customer Id**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Find the **SaaS Analysis Server Host** and obtain the **SaaS Psockets Server host** replacing *agents* by *psockets*. For example if the analysis server host is *agents.apm.my_environment.aternity.com* then the SaaS Psockets Server host is *psockets.apm.my_environment.aternity.com*
3. Download the **Aternity APM Java agent for Linux** package or contact [Riverbed support](https://support.riverbed.com/) to obtain a copy, for example *aternity-apm-jida-linux-12.18.0_BL546.zip*

### Step 2. Prepare the image

1. Save the package of the Aternity APM Java agent for Linux in local folder, for example in "Tech-Community/202-containerize-apm-with-java-app", and rename the file as "aternity-apm-jida-linux.zip" - just removing the suffix part that is the version number.

2. Download the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aternity/Tech-Community/main/202-containerize-apm-with-java-app/Dockerfile).

3. Open a shell in your local folder, and just execute the build command.

```shell
docker build --tag cookbook-202 .
```

### Step 3. Run the container

In the command below replace the value with your own info (see Step 1) and run a container:
1. **Customer Id** in the variable RVBD_CUSTOMER_ID, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. **SaaS Psockets Server host** in the variable RVBD_ANALYSIS_SERVER, for example *psockets.my_environment.aternity.com*

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e RVBD_CUSTOMER_ID="1234-12341243" -e RVBD_ANALYSIS_SERVER="psockets.apm.my_environment.aternity.com" cookbook-202
```

### Step 4. Navigate on the app

The web application should now be available on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Then, open the url in your browser and refresh the page few times to generate some traffic.

### Step 5. Aternity APM webconsole 

Go to the Aternity APM webconsole to observe the transactions of that instance.
